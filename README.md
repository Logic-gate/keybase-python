What is Keybase?
================

From [their website](https://keybase.io/):

> Keybase is two things.
> 
> 1. a public, publicly-auditable directory of keys and identity proofs
> 1. a protocol (this API) for accessing the directory

Keybase has an existing command line written in Node.js as well as [a well documented HTTP API](https://keybase.io/__/api-docs/1.0).
